# Instructions for running. 
This program is built in visual studio code vs 1.99.3 with ASP.Net Core 9 rasor pages.
The database is Sqlite and is included in the project as a file.

To begin, download the project, then build with dotnet build command in the terminal powershell.
Then run with the debugger inbuilt to VS code with C# and run the SignaPayProcess project.
It will have you choose a browser and it will run.

Once it running, files can be uploaded and processed into the db from the Upload file page.
Existing files can be reprocessed on the home page.
Transactions can be manually created on the transactions page.
Tranactions can be also be edited and deleted on the transaction page.
Files can be deleted as well on the home page.
Transaction time stamps are the unique identifies in the DB and can be viewed but not edited except on creation of a new record.

The app needs SQL for a production role and url and https cert. None of that is configured. 
Thus dotnet publish will run, but the DB will throw an error due to the lack of SQL server and configuation.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

The instuctions below were the inspiration for this project.

# Card Processor

Thank you for taking a the time to complete our interview code project. We realize that there are many ways to conduct the "technical part" of the interview process from L33T code tests to whiteboards, and each has its own respective pros / cons. We intentionally chose the take-home project approach because we believe it gives you the best chance to demonstrate your skills and knowledge in a "normal environment" - i.e. your computer, keyboard, and IDE.

This short exercise is designed to give us a sense of how you approach full stack development. Weâ€™re looking for clarity of thought, communication, and code organization â€” not perfection or a complete product.

Please treat this as something youâ€™d spend **3-5 hours** on. If anything is unclear or you'd make a different decision in a real-world scenario, feel free to call that out.

We encourage you to have fun with the project, while producing a solution that you believe accurately represents how you would bring your skillset to the team.

We have attempted to make this repo as clear as possible, but if you have any questions, we encourage you to reach out.

## ðŸ“Ÿ Overview

Youâ€™ll build a small system that mimics a simplified credit card transaction processor. Your submission should include:

- A **web-based user interface**
  - including a **reporting view** to summarize processed data
- A **server component** with appropriate business logic
- **Data persistence** (in-memory, file-based, or database - your choice)

---

## ðŸ§¹ Requirements

You can implement this however you like, as long as the following functionality is covered:

### 1. User Interface

- A minimal web interface for interacting with the system
- Includes a way to view and/or submit transaction data
- Can be built using any approach / tech stack you prefer

### 2. Logic

- You need to accept transaction records
  - These records will come from the provided files
  - The files in the test directory are smaller and meant to ease development
  - The files in the data directory are larger and mean to be the "real transactions"
- Each record includes a card number, timestamp, and amount
- Each directory contains 3 files that need to be processed to capture all transactions
- Card type is determined by the leading character of the card as follows:
  - Amex (3)
  - Visa (4)
  - MasterCard (5)
  - Discover (6)
- Invalid or unrecognized card numbers should be rejected

### 3. Persistence

- Transactions must be stored and retrievable after creation
- Choose any persistence mechanism

### 4. Reporting

- Provide summaries of total processed volume:
  - By Card
  - By Card Type
  - By Day (based on timestamp)
- Provide a list of "rejected" transactions

## âœ… What Weâ€™re Looking For

- Clear, maintainable code
- A working implementation of the core requirements
- Reasonable structure and organization
- Good judgment in scoping and tradeoffs

Bonus points (not required) for:

- Tests
- Clear commit history
- Clean and responsive UI

## ðŸ§  Final Thoughts and Hints

- In this scenario, you are the initial architect creating the first pass at this project. You can consider our review the same as a Senior level engineer coming on to the project. Make sure that when we "pick up" the repo, it is clear how to stand up the project, run the solution, and potentially contribute code
- Since you are tackling this specific project, our expectation is that you are at a senior engineer level. While we 100% want your code to represent your preferred style, there are some things we consider "basic" that should be in your submission. These include ideas like the following list. This list is not exhaustive, it is meant to point in a direction:
  - Clear, consistent, readable code
  - Proper use of your selected stack
    - for example, if you choose C#, we would expect to see IOC/DI appropriately implemented
  - DRY
  - Low cyclomatic complexity
  - Low Coupling / High Cohesion
  - Clear thought and patterns for maintainability and expansion
    - This scenario is obviously simplified from reality, that said you should consider future requests like other transaction types, different file formats, etc. - this will at minimum, be a topic in the conversation
- While it should be obvious, this scenario involves "money". This means numerical accuracy is required and at least minimal security should be considered in your submission (we aren't going to "hack your solution", but there shouldn't be open API endpoints either).
- We do NOT expect you to be a designer, we do expect you to consider your user and make the experience intuitive and easy to use
