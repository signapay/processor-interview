## General considerations
- All the code is written with typescript and react.
- The code is organized in two folders Back and front.
- Each one contains is onwn README file with considereations .
- I didn't have eniugh time to upload the code to the cloud (eg aws or vercel) I tried to respect the time limit of 5 hours.
- The code is not optimized for production, as is is not uploaded to the cloud. the freontend is not calling the backend but it supports its response.
